Python Developer Practical Exam for Valens Research

The assessment was not completed. However, the parts that I did complete were:
- creation of Django project
- creation of Homepage App with a placeholder template
- creation of a Car model
- migration of Car model

The idea was to use a linked list (next_id_pointer in Car model) to create the ordered list.
This was done as linked lists are more efficient for changing orders rather than regular lists
with indices. Traversal would have been mroe difficult to program than regular lists, with the
next_id_pointer fields used to access the next cars in the order, however this would have been
equally efficient.
